Hey! Kingly Hub is a script for the Roblox game, The Strongest Battlegrounds! This script was built off of FluentPlus! All credits goes to the respective authors.
(no logo rn hehe)
Just copy the script, hit execute, then you're done!
Or, execute this instead;

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxtric158/Kingly-Hub/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()
