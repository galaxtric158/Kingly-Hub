Hey! Kingly Hub is a script for the Roblox game, The Strongest Battlegrounds, in the future, I am planning to make a universal script for other games, based off of this! (Kingly) ! This script was built off of FluentPlus (TSBG)! All credits goes to the respective authors.
note for the future; I will most likely use different UI libraries in the future (such as luna) (for other games), but for now, i'll stick to fluent/fluentplus for tsbg.

(no logo rn hehe)
Just copy the script, hit execute, then you're done!

The script itself;
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxtric158/Kingly-Hub/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()
