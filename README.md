## What is Kingly Hub?
Hey! Kingly Hub is a script for the Roblox game, The Strongest Battlegrounds, in the future, I am planning to make a universal script for other games, based off of this! (Kingly) ! This script was built off of FluentPlus (TSBG)! All credits goes to the respective authors.
note for the future; I will most likely use different UI libraries in the future (such as luna) (for other games), but for now, i'll stick to fluent/fluentplus for tsbg.

* Now, Just copy the script, hit execute, then you're done!
> [!IMPORTANT]

### - The Strongest Battlegrounds

## The script itself;
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxtric158/Kingly-Hub/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()
```

> [!TIP]
> My code is open source, so feel free to modify and create your own script based off of mine!.

> Please make sure to add credits if you are planning to use my script/modify it.


> [!NOTE]
> My script uses different user interface libraries for different games (some might be the same, though.)
