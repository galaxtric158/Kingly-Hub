## What is Kingly Hub?
Kingly Hub is a universal script hub that I personally created to run scripts on certain games. 

* To run the script, just copy it, paste it to your executor, hit execute on your executor, and now, you're done!
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Below is a list of all the games that Kingly Hub natively supports.

- The Strongest Battlegrounds
  
## The script itself;
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxtric158/Kingly-Hub/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()
```

> [!TIP]
> My code is open source, so feel free to modify and create your own script based off of mine!.

> Please make sure to add credits if you are planning to use my script/modify it.


> [!NOTE]
> My script uses different user interface libraries for different games (some might be the same, though.)
